====================

 - A trivial non-optimized solution is shown in trivial.html
 - A more optimized solution using the binary search algorithm (divide and conquer) is proposed as the actual solution (MergeSortedArrays.js)
 - Jasmine test cases available under the spec folder, and source file under the src folder
